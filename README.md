# Propulsion Subsystem Performance
Matlab application for Spacecraft Subsystems course assignment in MS Spacecraft Design at LTU Space Campus.

## Exercise 1
Calculate the thrust, the effective exhaust velocity, the pressure in the combustion chamber and the specific impulse of a thruster which has characteristic velocity c* = 1220, a thrust coefficient C_f = 1.5, mass flow rate mdot_p and throat area A_t = 0.0248 m^2.

## Exercise 2
Calculate the throat area A_t, the exit area A_e, the thrust coefficient C_f, and the characteristic velocity c* of a thruster, with a nozzle which is ideally expanded (P_e = P_a) at the sea level pressure, and provides a thrust of T = 500 kN, and specific impulse Isp = 300 s. The propellant has a molecular weight M = 15 kg/kmol, gamma = 1.4, and the combustion temperature is T_c = 3300 K.

## Exercise 3
Calculate the Delta V and the propellant mass m_p  necessary to perform a Hohmann orbital transfer from a GEO orbit to a h = 600 k m  height circular orbit. How long do the apogee and perigee manoeuvres last? The initial spacecraft mass is m_0 = 100 kg, the specific impulse is Isp = 318s and the mass flow rate of the thruster is mdot_p = 0.135 kg/s.
